# RL Project

### What is this?

This is one of my bachelor degree projects.
In my university there are three projects that contribute to my final score (up to 6 points).

This one in particular is the final project from the course "Reti Logiche" so the project is about logical networks and VHDL programming.

### Try it yourself!

If you want to try it yourself, I leave the [rules](Rules.pdf) and the [specification](Specification.pdf) files.

To get perfect score you need to run successfully all simulations inside [Simulation](Simulation).
